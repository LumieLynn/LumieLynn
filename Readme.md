## 1.Some...Gossip?
Like most students in China, I finished my high school study after college entrance examination.
I used to be PAINFUL about EVERY exam I had taken.~~FUCK U MATHEMATICS (｡◕∀◕｡)~~ But, after finishing my last subject, a huge emptiness overwhelmed my mind. Sometimes I feel quite nostalgic for that time.
But, whatever. Nobody likes suffering. Same as me. (=ﾟωﾟ)=
## 2.blah - blah - blah ( ﾟπ。)
Does ...anyone like classical music?  (   ﾟ3ﾟ)
I spend most of my leisure time listening to Beethoven. But recently I'm trying some new pieces from different period ,like *Overtune 1812*, *Mahler's Symphony No.1* and some pieces from Rimsky-Korsakov.
These albums are in my playlists(`ε´ ):
```markdown
Lucerne Festival - Abbado conducts Mahler Symphonies
Karajan conducts Beethoven *1963 DG*
Vivaldi - The Four Season *From Anne-Sophie Mutter*
Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto/Marche slave/Romeo and Juliet/"1812" Overtune
and so on...
```
If you also like classical music, could you let me know about that?(`ε´ )
